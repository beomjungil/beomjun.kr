Right now, South Korea is in the middle of the Lunar New Year holiday. Thanks to this, I feel like I’ll have enough time to reset and reorganize myself. With the new year starting by any measure, I’ve been reflecting on what goals I should set to make this year different from the last. In particular, I’m recalling and organizing things I’ve wanted to do but couldn’t accomplish before.

I don’t regret starting work earlier than others. However, these days, thoughts of things I haven’t experienced because of work often cross my mind on my way home. Sometimes, I wonder if I’m missing out on these experiences.

That’s why, before I say goodbye to my twenties, I’ve decided to start preparing little by little for the things I’ve always wanted to do this year.
